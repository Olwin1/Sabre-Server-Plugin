##First Minecraft Plugin
I created a Minecraft plugin to add some features that I wanted for my server. The plugin includes:

- Item Droppers: This feature allows players to drop items in a designated area without the risk of losing them.

- Seamless Teleporting: Players can teleport without any interruptions or glitches.

- Buy Inventories: This feature lets players buy inventories with in-game currency.

Honestly looking at it hurts me :/
